# RoboISM-Project-1
My first ever Robotics Project. Related to avoiding vehicle collisions on highways in foggy situations during winter.
I have used ESP WROOM 32 development board for this project.
The sensors used are Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) and Gas Detection sensor (MQ-2).
Apart from the sensors and board, other components used are Red and Green LEDs, 270 ohm Resistors, Jumper wires, breadboard.
The file "us_sensor_code" has the code for HC-SR04 sensor.
The file "gas_sensor" has the code for MQ-2 Gas Sensor.
