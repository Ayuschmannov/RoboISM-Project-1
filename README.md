# RoboISM-Project-1
My first ever Robotics Project. Related to avoiding vehicle collisions on highways in foggy situations during winter.
Every year in India as well as many other places in the world, there is a major problem during foggy situations in winter due to poor visibility on highways. Every year hundreds of people loose their lives due to this prevailing problem.
Through this project, I have tried to solve this issue to a great extent. Though my working is on a smaller scale, but this can easily be scaled up in minimal cost.
In this project, I monitor the distance between our car and the vehicle in front of us; and it gives a warning if the distance is way too close. Also I monitor the smoke/fog level in the area and give out a warning on Serial Monitor if it crosses a defined level. The Serial Monitor can easily be implemented in most modern day cars because they already have an infotainment screen on their dashboard.
I have used ESP WROOM 32 development board for this project.
The sensors used are Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) and Gas Detection sensor (MQ-2).
Apart from the sensors and board, other components used are Red and Green LEDs, 270 ohm Resistors, Jumper wires, breadboard.
The file "us-sensor-code" has the code for HC-SR04 sensor.
The file "gas-sensor-code" has the code for MQ-2 Gas Sensor.
**The outputs on Serial Monitors have been shown in "Closed Issues".** Thank you :)
